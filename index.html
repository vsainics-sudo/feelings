                    My dearest friend, I am so sorry for not treating you right. I realize now how much I've hurt you, and it breaks my heart. You mean the world to me, and I love you more than words can say. I promise I will never do this again. I will always care for you, support you, and be there for you through everything. Please forgive me.
