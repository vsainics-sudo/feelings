                    Every moment without you feels like an eternity. I miss your smile, your laughter, and the way you light up my world. I can't wait to see you again, to hold you close, and to make new memories together. I'm looking forward to picking you up from the station, wrapping you in my arms, and never letting go. You mean everything to me, and I promise to cherish every second we have together.
